This is an Android App to display River Water Level in New Brunswick, Canada.

The application uses real time water levels obtained from stations operated by Environment Canada, NB Power and U.S. Geological Survey.
Weather input are provided by Environment Canada, U. S. National Weather Service, and Quebec Environment.

Current version 1.0

Things to be added in the future:

- add code documentation
- add option to provide water level according to the closest location to user.
- add a more discriptive warning sign to indicate if river level is in safe levels or not so that users would know when to return to their homes.
  ** I am displaying the river level in meters because I don't know at what hight the river is too high or too low so I need someone to give me this information so that I can implement it in the app.
